# Backend assigment
This is my first experience with PhalconPHP. It was fun and I enjoyed learning another framework features. 

In a production enviroment I'd add some authentication method (oauth2, jwt...) to this API. Probably 

CREATE NEW FILE
curl -i -X POST -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" -F "data=@australian_rail.csv" http://localhost

GET FILE LIST
curl -i -X GET http://localhost

GET FILE INFO
curl -i -X GET http://localhost/20


# Frontend assignment

Also my first experience with Foundation framework, I'm more familiar with bootstrap but I liked Foundation features.
